title: An Immersed Domain Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction with Contact
description: "
We present an immersed domain approach for the numerical solution of contact problems between multiple elastic structures immersed in a fluid flow.
We simulate the full dynamics of a bio-prosthetic heart valve. We model the blood-valve interaction, the blood-aortic wall interaction, and the contact among leaflets during the valve closure.
The solid structures are modeled as hyperelastic and anisotropic materials, whereas the fluid is considered Newtonian. The mathematical modeling of such material properties and the contact mechanics give rise to a large-scale nonlinear problem that is both challenging and computationally expensive.
We employ a localized version of the L2-projection for handling the fluid-structure volumetric coupling and a variant of the mortar method for coupling the surfaces of the structures in contact.
We illustrate one verification test and a fully coupled fluid-structure-contact interaction simulation of a bio-prosthetic heart valve placed in the aortic root."
