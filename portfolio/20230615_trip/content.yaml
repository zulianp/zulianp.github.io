title: Scalable matrix-free solver for 3D transfer of polarized
radiation in stellar atmospheres
description: "We present an eﬃcient and massively parallel solution strategy for the transfer problem of
polarized radiation, for a 3D stationary medium out of local thermodynamic equilibrium.
Scattering processes are included accounting for partial frequency redistribution effects.
Such a setting is one of the most challenging ones in radiative transfer modeling. The
problem is formulated for a two-level atomic model, which allows linearization. The
discrete ordinate method alongside an exponential integrator are used for discretization.
Eﬃcient solution is obtained with a Krylov method equipped with a tailored physics-based
preconditioner. A matrix-free approach results in a lightweight implementation, suited
for tackling large problems. Near-optimal strong and weak scalability are obtained with
two complementary decompositions of the computational domain. The presented approach
made it possible to perform simulations for the Ca i line at 4227Å with more than 109
degrees of freedom in less than half an hour on massively parallel machines, always
converging in a few iterations for the proposed tests."
