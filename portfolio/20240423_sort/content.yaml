title: "Data-centric workloads with MPI_Sort"
description: "
Sorting is a fundamental task in computing and plays a central role in information technology. The advent
of rack-scale and warehouse-size data processing shaped the architecture of data analysis platforms towards
supercomputing. In turn, established techniques on supercomputers have become relevant to a wider range
of application domains. This work is concerned with multi-way mergesort with exact splitting on distributed
memory architectures. At its core, our approach leverages a novel and parallel algorithm for multi-way selection
problems. Remarkably concise, the algorithm relies on MPI_Allgather and MPI_ReduceScatter_block,
two collective communication schemes that find hardware support in most high-end networks. A software
implementation of our approach is used to process the Terabyte-size Data Challenge 2 signal, released by the
SKA radio telescopes organization. On the supercomputer considered herein, our approach outperforms the state
of the art by up to 2.6X using 9,216 cores. Our implementation is released as a compact open source library
compliant to the MPI programming model. By supporting the most popular elementary key types, and arbitrary
fixed-size value types, the library can be straightforwardly integrated into third-party MPI-based software."
